# RSA-Cryptosystem
RSA is a public-key cryptosystem that is widely used for secure data transmission while also one of the oldest.
The program is designed to perform encryption and decryption without using the built-in cryptographic libraries of Java. Instead, the program implements a custom encryption algorithm, which involves techniques such as substitution, transposition and permutation.

To use the program, the user would input a message to be encrypted, along with the public key of the intended recipient. The program would then perform the encryption process and output the encrypted message, which could be sent to the recipient. To decrypt a message, the recipient would input the encrypted message along with their private key, and the program would perform the decryption process to reveal the original message.
My program provides a unique approach to encryption and decryption that goes beyond the built-in capabilities of Java. It demonstrates an understanding of encryption principles and the ability to implement custom algorithms using Java programming.
